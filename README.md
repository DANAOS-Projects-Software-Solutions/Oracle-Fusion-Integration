## 🏗️ What is ProjectVIEW ERP?

**ProjectVIEW ERP is a full-scope Tier-1 ERP platform engineered for capital-intensive, project-driven industries.**  
Designed to serve the entire BUILD World—construction, EPC/EPCI, marine & offshore engineering, mining & quarrying, shipbuilding, and project-based manufacturing—ProjectVIEW ERP unifies land, offshore, site, and yard operations into one integrated system.

Every process in ProjectVIEW ERP is benchmarked against:

- **Time**, via Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  
- **Cost**, via Bill of Quantities (BoQ)  

This creates a *living, dynamic execution model* where deviations are detected early, processes re-align automatically, and financial truth is always connected to engineering reality.
